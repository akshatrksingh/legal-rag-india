It is further stated that office of the Registrar General of India has also issued a circular dated 3.9.2021 to provide a medical certificate of cause of death to the next of the kin of the deceased. Under the guidelines dated 3.9.2021, it is provided as under: “Government of India Ministry of Health & Family Welfare & Indian Council of Medical Research Guidelines for Official Document for COVID19 Death (lssued in compliance to the Hon'ble Supreme Court order dated 30.06.2021 in WP(Civil) No. 539 and WP (Civil) 554 of 2021) . 1.Background Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Ministry of Health & Family Welfare have been issuing specific guidelines to States/UTs based on World Health Organization's (WHO) guidelines & global best practices on reporting Covid deaths. Relevant officers in States/UTs have also been trained on correct recording of deaths related to Covid-19. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 539 and 554 of 2021 directed the Central Government to issue simplified guidelines for issuance of Official Document relating to COVID-19 deaths to the family members of the deceased, who died due to COVID-19. Hon'ble Court had directed that such guidelines may also provide the remedy to the family members of the deceased who died due to COVID-19 for correction of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death/Official Document issued by the 6 appropriate authority. 2. Guiding Principles i. COVID-19 cases, for the purpose of these Guidelines, are those which are diagnosed through a positive RT-PCR/ Molecular Tests/ RAT OR clinically determined through investigations in a hospital/ in-patient facility by a treating physician, while admitted in the hospital/ in-patient facility. ii. Deaths occurring due to poisoning, suicide, homicide, deaths due to accident etc. will not be considered as COvID-19 deaths even if COVID19 is an accompanying condition. 3. Scenario based approach and interventions i. COVID-19 cases which are not resolved and have died either in hospital settings or at home, and where a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) in Form 4 & 4 A has been issued to the registering authority as required under Section 10 of the Registration of Birth and Death (RBD) Act, 1969, will be treated as a COVID-19 death. Registrar General of India (RGI) will issue necessary guidelines to Chief Registrars of all States/UTs. ii. As per the study by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 95% i. deaths take place within 25 days of being tested Covid positive. To make the scope broader and more inclusive, deaths occurring within 30 days from the date of testing or from the date of being clinically determined as a COVID-19 case, will be treated as 'deaths due to COVID-19, even if the death takes place outside the hospital/ in-patient facility. iii. However, a COVID-19 case, while admitted in the hospital in-patient ii. facility, and who continued as the same admission beyond 30 days, and died subsequently, shall be treated as a COVID-19 death. iv. In cases where the MCCD is not available or the next of kin of the deceased is not satisfied with the cause of death given in MCCD (Form 4/4A), and which are not covered by the aforesaid scenarios, the States/ UTs shall notify a Committee at district level consisting of Additional District Collector, Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH), Additional CMOH/ Principal or HOD Medicine of a Medical College (if one exists in the district) and a subject expert, for issuance of the Official Document for COVID-19 Death. The Committee will follow the 7 procedure outlined below: a. The next of kin of the deceased shall submit a petition to the District Collector for issuance of the appropriate Official Document for COVID- 19 Death. b. The Official Document for COVID-19 Death will be issued in the format annexed to these Guidelines by the aforesaid district-level Committee after due examination and verification of all facts. c. The Official Document for COvID-19 Death shall also be communicated to Chief Registrars of States/UTs and Registrar of Birth and Death, who issued the death certificate. d. The Committee shall also examine the grievances of the next of kin of the deceased, and propose necessary remedial measures, including issuance of amended Official Document for COVID-19 Death after verifying facts in accordance with these guidelines. e. e. The applications for issuance of Official Document for COVID-19 Death and for redressal of grievances shall be disposed off within 30 days of submission of the application/ grievance.” 6. It provided that the deaths occurring due to poisoning, suicide, homicide, deaths due to accident etc. will not be considered as Covid-19 deaths even if Covid-19 is an accompanying condition. 7. On the last date of hearing, a concern was shown on some of the clauses in the guidelines dated 3.9.2021 including the deaths occurring due to poisoning, suicide, homicide, deaths due to accident etc. will not be considered as Covid-19 deaths even if Covid-19 is an accompanying condition. 7.1 A concern was also shown with respect to Grievance Redressal Mechanism in case of any grievance with regard to certification of the death. To that, under the guidelines dated 11.09.2021 in clause 9, a provision is 8 made with respect to constitution of a Grievance Redressal Committee at District level consisting of the members mentioned in clause 9 of the guidelines dated 11.09.2021, which is reproduced hereinabove. 8.
