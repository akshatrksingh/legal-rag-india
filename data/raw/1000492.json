No cogent grounds have been furnished for the delay between 20 and 26 months by the two parties in filing their applications for review. The judges comprising the two-judge bench in Goa Foundation II, Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta, retired from this Court on 30 December 2018 and 6 May 2020, respectively. The State of Goa preferred its four review petitions in the month of November 2019, after Justice Madan B Lokur’s retirement, while Vedanta Limited preferred its four review petitions in the month of August 2020, right after Justice Deepak Gupta’s retirement. Such practise must be firmly disapproved to preserve the institutional sanctity of the decision making of this Court. The review petitioners were aware of the decision of this Court. 3 Keeping in mind the above, we are inclined to dismiss these review petitions on the ground of limitation alone. However, in any event, we also find that no 1 (2018) 4 SCC 218, hereinafter referred to as “Goa Foundation II” 5 legitimate grounds for review of the judgment in Goa Foundation II have been made out, and dismiss these review petitions on merits as well. 4 Pending application(s), if any, are disposed of. .………….…………………...........................J.
