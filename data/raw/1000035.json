RESPONDENT(S) O R D E R Delay condoned. The present Review Petition has been filed to recall the judgment of this Court dated 04.05.2017 passed in Civil Appeal No.6179 of 2017 @ SLP(C)No.38303 of 2016 along with bunch of matters, filed at the instance of Govt.of NCT of Delhi. Counsel for the Review Petitioner submits that the very same common judgment dated 07.07.2015 passed by the Delhi High Court, was a subject matter of challenge by the Govt.of NCT of Delhi as well as by the present Review Petitioner – Delhi Development Authority in SLP(C)No.8779 of 2016. Due to some inadvertence the Civil Appeal preferred by Govt.of NCT of Delhi tag along with other matter(s) and came to be 2 dismissed. Although, it was not connected with the bunch of matters which were decided by this Court. After we heard counsel for the parties, the judgment dated 04.05.2017 passed in Civil Appeal No.6179 of 2017 @ SLP(C)No.38303 of 2016 filed at the instance of Govt.of NCT of Delhi deserves to be recalled. Accordingly, Review Petition is allowed. The judgment dated 04.05.2017 passed in Civil Appeal No.6179 of 2017 @ SLP(C)No.38303 of 2016 is recalled and restored to its original number and to be heard along with SLP(C)No.8779/2016 filed by the Delhi Development Authority. ...............
