The controversy raised in the Review Petition was already dealt with in a series of decisions of the High Court. Consistent with said decisions of the High Court, the certificate issued by Sister Nivedita College, Kolkata before the National Council for Teacher Education Act, 1993 came into effect, was accepted to be a good and valid qualification. 2 We have gone through the grounds raised in the Review Petition and do not find any error apparent on record to justify interference in Review Jurisdiction. This Review Petition is, therefore, dismissed. …………………………J. [Uday Umesh Lalit] …………………………J. [Vineet Saran] New Delhi; November 30, 2021.",
