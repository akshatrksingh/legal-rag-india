ETC.ETC. …Respondents 2 O R D E R Applications for listing Review Petitions in open Court are rejected. Applications for permission to file Review Petitions are allowed. The judgment under review had considered the rival submissions and all the circumstances on record and then concluded that compensation awarded by the Reference Court at the rate of Rs.120/- per square yard was the correct measure and that the market value determined by the High Court could not be sustained either on the basis of the sale-deeds or on the strength of judicial order. We have gone through the contents of the Review Petitions. None of the ground raised in support of the Review Petitions makes out any error apparent on record to justify interference in Review Jurisdiction. All the Review Petitions are, therefore, dismissed. …………………………J. [Uday Umesh Lalit] …………………………J. [Hemant Gupta] …………………………J. [S. Ravindra Bhat] New Delhi; December 08, 2021.",
