Advocates purchase such aforementioned vehicles as old vehicles, they do not get such vehicles registered in their own names whereas the actual/registered owners of those vehicles have already died. Despite of death of original owner, fake General Power of Attorneys are executed/prepared in the names of such deceased vehicle owners through their companions advocates. Aforementioned vehicles are shown in such road accident, which were occurred from unknown vehicles. Aforementioned vehicles have been shown in accident in many such cases and compensations petitions have been instituted.  In the cases of such road accidents wherein First Information Reports are registered against unknown vehicles and when those unknown vehicles are not traced and local Investigating Officers submit their Final Report in the cases before the Hon'ble Courts. In such 7 accidents if a person has died while travelling in those vehicles and second person has injured, then holding that injured person himself to be driver of the aforementioned vehicle, showing his negligence, by impleading as opposite party to the insurance company of his own vehicle for receiving compensation, compensation petitions are also filed for receiving amount of compensation. 2. CASES OF KNOWN VEHICLES WITHOUT INSURANCE.  If road accident is occurred with known vehicle and not insured at that time, in connivance with owner or driver of other insured vehicle in place of that vehicle, compensation petitions are instituted by showing aforementioned road accident of the said insured vehicle. 3. CASES OF FICTIONAL ACCIDENT AND FALSE PETITIONS  Such false compensation petitions have also come into light wherein name and address of the petitioner could not be ascertained and imaginary story is created on behalf of such petitioner and false Claim petitions are instituted. 4. CASES RELATED TO CONNIVANCE OF VEHICLE OWNER/VEHICLE DRIVER/ADVOCATE  For the purpose of earning illegal money, some actual vehicle owners and actual drivers of vehicles in connivance with advocates, submits registration certificates of their vehicles and Driver Licences in the unknown motor accident cases for filing fake petitions. 5. IMPLEADING NAME AND ADDRESS OF FAKE PERSONS IN ACTUAL ACCIDENTS  Persons of fake names and addresses showing as drivers/cleaners in place of actual and correct injured persons (driver/cleaner) involved in the actual accident cases, compensation petitions are instituted in the W.C.A. courts by showing them injured in the aforementioned accidents. 6. CASES RELATED TO HANDICAPPED/ DECEASED PERSONS DUE TO OTHER REASONS  During course of enquiry/investigation, such fake compensation petitions have also come into light wherein petitioner has become handicapped due to some other reason (like chopping off hand from thrasher machine), and second copy of fake handicapped certificates of their being disabled/ handicapped obtained again showing date of accident after date of fake accident and fake compensation petitions have also been instituted.  Despite not being injured in the road accidents, after death or injured for any other reasons, his family members or he himself showing him or that person to be the driver/cleaner/labourer who died or injured, compensation petitions are instituted in fake manner. 8 7. CASES RELATED TO FILING SAME CASE IN MORE THAN ONE COURTS  In one road accident, wherein a person has died or injured, his family members or he himself submits compensation petition in the M.A.C.T. court related to aforementioned road accident. If decision of the court is not in his favour, then the same petitioner changes the story and again submits his petition before the W.C.A. court (Workmen’s Compensation Act).  After institution of compensation related to a road accident in a court and after receiving its compensation amount, again same accident is shown with other vehicle which is insured with other insurance company and second Claim petition is instituted in the W.C.A. court of any other district for receiving compensation amount again. 8.

INSTITUTION OF PETITIONS IN OTHER DISTRICT INSTEAD OF INSTITUTING PETITIONS IN THE DISTRICT OF ACCIDENT SPOT/PLACE  During investigation/enquiry of the compensation petitions, it is also found that some compensation petitions were not instituted in the court of district of place/spot of accident, rather they were instituted in the court of other district by mentioning only temporary address instead of 9 mentioning original address of the petitioner. It is also pertinent to mention here that this temporary address also remains incomplete. 11. CASES RELATED TO FAKE VAKALATNAMA  During investigation/enquiry of the compensation petitions related to road accidents, this fact has also come into light that actual/main advocate who has filed the claim petition, does not submit his own Vakalatnama in the concerned court, he submits Vakalatnama on behalf of such Advocate, who does not file the compensation petitions by mentioning his mobile number on the compensation petitions.  During investigation/enquiry of the compensation petitions related to road accidents, this fact has also come into light that advocate who has submitted compensation petition in the concerned court, he mentioned name of such fake person in place of name of Advocate, whose whereabouts could not be ascertained. Whereas such case was pursued by the advocate who submitted this petition in camouflage manner. 7.2 Shri Atul Nanda and Shri Vishnu Mehra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the two insurance companies have submitted that despite various directions issued by this Court as well as the various High Courts, there is non-adherence to the provisions of Section 158(6) (pre 2019 amendment) and Section 159 (post 2019 amendment) of the Motor Vehicles Act. Reliance is placed on the decisions of this Court in the cases of General Insurance Council v. State of Andhra Pradesh, reported in (2007) 12 SCC 354; General Insurance Council v. State of Andhra Pradesh, reported in (2010) 6 SCC 768; Jai Prakash v.

It is submitted that this Court in its order dated 16.03.2021 passed in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 534/2020 has issued the following directions: 10 A. Accident Information Report- The jurisdictional police station shall report the accident under Section 158(6) of the Act (Section 159 post 2019 amendment) (hereinatfer “the report”) to the tribunal and insurer within first 48 hours either over email or a dedicated website.

For this purpose, the tribunal shall maintain a bank account and record the relevant account details along with the directions for payment to the insurer in the award itself. G. Each tribunal shall create an email ID peculiar to its jurisdiction for receiving the emails from the police and the insurer as mentioned above. Similarly, all insurer throughout India shall also create an email ID peculiar to the jurisdiction of each claim tribunal. These email IDs would be prominently displayed at tribunal, the police stations and the office of the insurers for the benefit of the claimants. Similarly, these email IDS shall also be prominently displayed on the website maintained by the tribunal and the insurer. 11 H. Insurers shall appoint nodal officers for each tribunal and provide their contact details, phone and mobile phone numbers, and email address to Director Generals of State Police and the tribunals. 7.3 Shri Atul Nanda, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited has also made two suggestions in its note. He has submitted that if the earlier directions issued by this Court in the aforesaid decisions are implemented fully and in letter and spirit and Section 159 of the Motor Vehicles Act is complied with by all the Police Officers pan India and the accident information report as contemplated under Section 159 (post 2019 amendment) is out on the Government Portal – National Register of vehicle registration known as “VAHAN” AND “SAARTHI”, in that case, it can solve the problem of filing more than one claims in different States with respect to the same accident. It is submitted that the Transport Authorities under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is maintaining a National Register of vehicle registration known as “VAHAN” AND “SAARTHI”. It is submitted that this has rendered the issuance and verification of the driving licenses and registration of vehicles, transparent and hassle free. It is submitted that these existing databases can be rendered useful for the purposes of adjudication of claims also if they can be expanded to include details of the accidents and drivers. It is submitted that if the “VAHAN” portal is modified to allow and the police officials who is investigating the accident 12 in question is required to mandatorily endorse an entry of the accident against such portal with an automatic intimation on the registered mobile of the owner, it will be very useful in preventing the submission of such fake claims. 7.4 It is further submitted by Shri Atul Nanda, learned senior counsel that SITs are required to be constituted in each of the States. It is submitted that only in the States of UP, Rajasthan and Gujarat, the SIT is existing. It is therefore prayed that the respective State Governments may be directed to constitute SIT with respect to complaints of suspicious fake claims/petitions which may be headed by an officer not below the rank of Additional Director General of Police, with adequate infrastructure and human resource. 8. Having heard learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respective insurance companies and the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State of UP/SIT and the suggestions made, we are of the opinion that before any further directions are issued, we may have the response from the Ministry of Transport, Government of India to have their suggestions for remedial and preventive measures for curbing the menace of filing of false/fraud claim petitions. We accordingly direct the Registry to implead the Ministry of Transport, Government of India as a party-respondent and issue notice. 13 We request Shri K.M. Nataraj, learned Additional Solicitor General of India to appear on behalf of the Ministry of Transport, Government of India and to assist the Court and to come out with suggestions how to curb the menace of filing false/fake claim petitions. After getting the response/suggestions, we may issue further directions to be applied pan India. Put up for further consideration on 25.01.2022. ………………………………..J. [M.R.
