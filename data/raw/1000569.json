RESPONDENT(S) O R D E R Having heard learned senior counsel for the appellant and having perused the material placed on record, we are not inclined to interfere in this matter at the instance of the appellant, particularly at this juncture when the Resolution Plan approved by the Committee of Creditors is pending for approval of the Adjudicating Authority. It goes without saying that the submissions sought to be made by the appellant could be the matter for consideration of the Adjudicating Authority, of course, strictly in accordance with law. In that regard, suffice it to say that any observations made in the impugned order shall not be of prejudice to the appellant in making the relevant submissions; and consideration thereof by the Adjudicating Authority. The appeal stands dismissed subject to the observations foregoing. All pending applications stand disposed of. ............... J. (DINESH MAHESHWARI) ............... J.
