  "doc": "1 REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA INHERENT JURISDICTION SUO MOTU CONTEMPT PETITION (CRL.) NO. 1 OF 2019 IN RE: MR. MATHEWS NEDUMPARA O R D E R th National By a judgment dated 12 March, 2019 in Lawyers Campaign for Judicial Transparency and Reforms & Ors Union of India and Ors . vs. . (Writ Petition (C) No. 191 of 2019), this Bench held that Shri Mathews Nedumpara, Advocate has committed contempt in the face of the Court. In the interest of justice, however, notice was issued to Shri Nedumpara as to the punishment to be imposed upon him for committing contempt in the face of the Court. Shri Nedumpara appeared today before us both by himself and through Advocate Shri Subhash Jha. 2 In the morning session, Shri Nedumpara did his best to see that the matter was not heard by this Bench. He informed us that a Transfer Petition was filed asking the Chief Justice of India to transfer this case from this Bench to some other Bench. He also stated that he was going to file an application for recall of our th order dated 12 March, 2019. He then cited latin maxims and said that justice must be seen to be done. He also referred to the famous Rex vs. Sussex Justices case and referred generally to the fact that relatives of Judges should not be seen practicing in the same Court. He later asked the Bench to grant a “pass over” of his matter inasmuch as his lawyer Shri Subhash Jha was on his way from Mumbai. The Bench agreed and placed the matter at 2.00 p.m. At 2.00 p.m., Shri Jha came and addressed us, and pointed out Sections 14 (1) & (2) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 together with Section 479 of the Criminal Procedure Code. He also made various other 3 submissions which the Court reminded him were not on the punishment aspect of this case. He continued, however, arguing as if he was arguing a review petition in the open Court. While Shri Jha was arguing, Shri Nedumpara stepped in again and went on a long ramble as to how he had not in fact impersonated Justice Vazifdar, which is one of the many incidents referred to in our th judgment dated 12 March, 2019. At this stage, Shri Nedumpara then tendered an apology to this Court by way of an affidavit duly signed by him in the Court in our presence. The affidavit reads as follows:- “AFFIDAVIT I, Mathews J. Nedumpara, Advocate, aged 60 years, Indian Inhabitant, residing at Harbour th Heights, “W” Wing, 12-F, 12 Floor, Sassoon Docks, Colaba, Mumbai-400 005, now in Delhi, do hereby swear and state as follows:- 1. A Bench of this Hon’ble Court comprising Hon’ble Shri Justice Rohinton F. Nariman and Hon’ble Shri Justice Vineet Saran, by judgment and th order dated 12 March, 2019, was pleased to hold 4 me guilty for contempt in the face of the Court and list the case for hearing on the question of punishment. 2. I happened to mention the name of Shri Fali S. Nariman to buttress my proposition that even legendary Shri Fali Nariman is of the view that the seniority of a lawyer should be reckoned from the date of his enrolment and nothing else. However, I was misunderstood. I along with some office bearers of the National Lawyers’ Campaign for Judicial Transparency and Reforms have instituted Writ Petition No.2199/2019 in the High Court of Delhi for a declaration that the Explanation to Rule 6 of the Bar Council of India Rules is void inasmuch as it explains that the word “Court” does not mean the entire Court, but the particular Court in which the relative of a lawyer is a Judge. I instituted the said petition only to raise the concern many lawyers share with me regarding the immediate relatives practising in the very same Court where their relative is a Judge. In retrospection I realize that it was an error on my part to have arrayed Shri Fali Nariman as a Respondent to the said petition. I regret the same; no words can sufficiently explain my contrition and regret. I also in retrospection 5 realize that I have erred even during the conduct of the above case before this Hon’ble Court and I probably would not have kept upto what is expected of me as a lawyer in the Bar for 35 years and crossed the age of 60. I feel sorry, express my contrition and tender my unconditional apology, while maintaining that some of the accusations th levelled against me in the judgment dated 12 March, 2019 are absolutely wrong, which are, ex facie, black and white, and as incontrovertible as day and night. 3. The apology tendered by me hereinabove be accepted and I may be purged of the contempt. Solemnly sworn at Delhi Sd/- th this 27 day of March, 2019 (Mathews J. Nedumpara)” We have considered the affidavit so filed in the light of the incidents that have taken place in the Bombay High Court as well as in this Court. Given the fact that Shri Nedumpara now undertakes to this Court that he will never again attempt to browbeat any Judge either of this Court or of the 6 Bombay High Court, we sentence Shri Nedumpara to three months imprisonment which is, however, suspended only if Shri Nedumpara continues in future to abide by the undertaking given to us today. In addition, Shri Nedumpara is barred from practicing as an Advocate before the Supreme Court of India for a period of one year from today. This disposes of the punishment aspect of the contempt that was committed in the face of the Court. A letter dated 23.03.2019, received by the office of the Judges of this Bench on 25.03.2019, is a letter that is sent to the President of India, the Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the High Court of Bombay by the President of the Bombay Bar Association and the President of the Bombay Incorporated law Society. The aforesaid letter states: “We have come across, in the social media, copies of the following complaints purportedly made against Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.F. Nariman and Hon’ble Mr. Justice Vineet Saran, Judges, Supreme Court of India. 7 1. A complaint made with Your Excellency’s Secretariat by one ‘Indian Bar Association’ dated th 20 March, 2019 bearing Grievance No.PRSEC/E/2019/05351 (“the first complaint”), through one Advocate Mr. Vijay Kurle, against sitting Judges of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, the Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.F.

Erasmo Jack de Sequeira (Dead) through L.Rs AIR 2012 SC 1727.” It can be seen on a comparison of the prayers in both the complaints that they are substantially similar showing that prima facie the aforesaid Shri Vijay Kurle and Shri Rashid Khan Pathan are acting in tandem. Also, 11 th th the complaints are dated 20 March, 2019 and 19 March, 2019. Para 3.14 of the said letter is significant and reads as follows: “3.14 The Bombay Bar Association and the Bombay Incorporated Law Society have reason to believe that Mr. Nilesh Ojha and Mr. Mathews Nedumpara are in tandem with one another. In Criminal contempt Petition No.3 of 2017, which was initiated as a result of various acts of Mr. Nilesh Ojha and his associates, Mr. Mathews Nedumpara appeared for one of the contemnors. Similarly, in a Petition being Writ Petition (L) No.1180 of 2018 filed by Mr. Mathews Nedumpara against Hon’ble Mr. Justice S.J. Kathawalla alleging “judicial defamation” and seeking compensation, Mr. Nilesh Ojha appeared for Mr. Mathews Nedumpara. The timing at which these complaints have been made after the bench comprising of Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.F. Nariman and Hon’ble Mr. Justice Vineet Saran of the Supreme Court of India held Mr. Mathews Nedumpara guilty of contempt of Court and also the contents of the complaint of Indian Bar Association make it apparent that these complaints are made to browbeat the Court for having initiated contempt proceedings against Mr. Mathews Nedumpara. It is pertinent to note that the Standing/Managing Committees of all the three Bar Associations attached to the Bombay High Court being Bombay Bar Association, Advocates’ Association of Western India, and the Bombay Incorporated Law Society passed Resolutions th appreciating and welcoming the judgment dated 12 March, 2019 of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India. Copies of the said Resolutions are hereto annexed and marked as Annexures “13”, “14” and “15”.” 12 We annex the aforesaid letter dated 23.03.2019 to the present order. Given the two complaints filed, it is clear that scandalous allegations have been made against the members of this Bench. We, therefore, issue notice of contempt to (1) Shri Vijay Kurle; (2) Shri Rashid Khan Pathan; (3) Shri Nilesh Ojha and (4) Shri Mathews Nedumpara to explain as to why they should not be punished for criminal contempt of the Supreme Court of India, returnable within two weeks from today. Given the serious nature of the allegations levelled against this Bench, the Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate Bench to hear and decide this contempt case. ..........................
