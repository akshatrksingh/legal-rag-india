OF 2021 (DIARY NO.24904 OF 2021) IN CIVIL APPEAL NOS.4526-4533 OF 2021 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ZILLA PARISHAD, …Petitioners AHMEDNAGAR & ANR. ETC. versus JANARDHAN APPASAHEB BARDE ETC. …Respondents WITH REVIEW PETITION (CIVIL) NOS. OF 2021 (DIARY NO.24898 OF 2021) IN CIVIL APPEAL NOS.4534-4541 OF 2021 O R D E R Delay in filing review petitions is condoned. Applications for listing of Review Petitions in open Court are dismissed. The orders passed by the Labour Court as well as the High Court on merits were found to be justified and, as such, this Court did not find any reason to interfere. 2 However, the rate of interest awarded at the rate of twelve per cent per annum was scaled down to eight per cent per annum. The grounds raised in the Review Petitions do not make out any error apparent on record to justify interference. These Review Petitions are, therefore, dismissed. …………………………J.
