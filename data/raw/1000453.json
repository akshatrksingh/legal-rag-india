The High Court had reduced the substantive sentence to six months which view was not under challenge either at the instance of prosecution or by the complainant. Considering the entirety of circumstances, the accused was directed to deposit Rs.2,50,000/- so that the complainant could be sufficiently compensated. Despite having been served, the complainant (Review Petitioner) chose not to enter appearance in this Court. 2 In these circumstances, the substantive sentence was reduced but at the same time, the amount of Rs.2,50,000/- was directed to be made over to the complainant. The complainant is now seeking review of the order passed by this Court. We have gone through the grounds raised in the Review Petition and do not find any error apparent to justify interference. This Review Petition is dismissed. …………………………J. [Uday Umesh Lalit] …………………………J. [Vineet Saran] …………………………J. [S. Ravindra Bhat] New Delhi; December 08, 2021.",
