No special visits to RHTC/UHTC 44. Dean was available only for day of assessment. 45. Common room not available. 46. MRD is not computerized. ICD not followed. 47. RHTC/UHTG not attached to College. 18. Taking note of the gross deficiencies, the MCI disapproved the request of the Petitioner-College for renewal of permission for admitting second batch of MBBS students for the academic year 2020-2021. Writ Petition No.72 of 2021. 19. The Petitioners are students who appeared in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) MBBS Examination held on 17th September, 2020. They were aggrieved by the decision taken by the MCI not to grant 25 | Pa ge approval for admissions to the three Medical Colleges in the State of Jharkhand at Districts Dumka, Hazaribagh and Palamu. The grievance of the Petitioners is that 300 seats out of 580 medical seats in the State of Jharkhand are allotted to the above named three Medical Colleges. If permission is not granted to the three Medical Colleges for making admissions for the academic year 2020-2021, the chances of the Petitioners pursuing medical course would reduce. Therefore, they have filed this Writ Petition seeking to quash the letter dated 15th October, 2020 issued by the MCI by which a decision was taken not to grant renewal of approval for admission of second batch of MBBS students to Hazaribagh Medical College. Further, the Petitioners sought a direction that they should be permitted to participate in the counselling and admission process for Dumka, Palamu and Hazaribagh Medical Colleges. 20. Establishment of Medical Colleges at Dumka, Palamu and Hazaribagh was an initiative taken by the State of Jharkhand to bolster the availability of medical seats in the State which would increase the number of Doctors in the State. However, a perusal of the facts mentioned above would show that not much interest has been taken by the State in ensuring that the necessary faculty, infrastructure 26 | Pa ge and other facilities are improved. A submission was made before this Court which led to the passing of an order dated 19th August, 2019 that the deficiencies in all the three Medical Colleges have been removed. While directing admissions to the three Medical Colleges, this Court directed an affidavit to be filed by the Principal Secretary, Department of Health, State of Jharkhand that deficiencies have been rectified. An affidavit of undertaking was directed to be filed by the Chief Secretary of the State of Jharkhand stating that the remaining deficiencies shall be removed within a period of three months from the date of the order. An affidavit was filed on 20th August, 2019 by the Secretary Department of Health, Medical Education and Family Welfare, Government of Jharkhand that certain deficiencies have been rectified and the remaining shall be rectified within a period of three months. The Chief Secretary of the State of Jharkhand filed an undertaking on 20th August, 2019 stating that the remaining deficiencies shall be removed within a period of three months. In the inspection conducted by the MCI to consider the renewal of permission for MBBS second batch of students for the academic year 2020-2021 gross deficiencies still continued to exist in the three Medical Colleges. Though, some laxity is shown in respect of medical Colleges 27 | Pa ge established by the State Government, permission cannot be granted for allotment of students to Medical Colleges which lack the necessary infrastructure and facilities. 21. Permission granted for admission for the academic year 2019-2020 is based on a statement made on behalf of the State of Jharkhand that the deficiencies pointed out by the MCI have been removed. It is clear that gross deficiencies still exist in spite of the affidavits and undertakings filed on behalf of the State of Jharkhand. No action has been taken to improve the situation. The State Government is directed to rectify all the deficiencies that have been pointed out by the MCI at the earliest and make an application for renewal of permission for admission of the second batch of MBBS students for the academic year 2021-2022. 22. For the aforementioned reasons, all the Writ Petitions are dismissed. Pending applications, if any, shall stand disposed of. .................................J. [L.
